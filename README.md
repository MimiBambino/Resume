Resume - Project 2 for Udacity's Frontend Developer Nanodegree
======

This is the resume project that I turned in for project 2 in Udacity's Nanodegree.  The Google Map in the resume 
no longer functions properly, but I left it as is to document what was actually turned in.  The live url is: 
http://mimibambino.github.io/Resume/.

I also have a related resume repository that is more up to date as well as more interesting.  It can be found here: 
https://github.com/MimiBambino/InteractiveResume and the live url is: http://mimibambino.github.io/InteractiveResume/.
